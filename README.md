## 📄 About the DDFA
The **Data Distribution Fairness Act (DDFA)** is a proposed Minnesota digital rights bill designed to:

- Require transparency when data is collected  
- Prohibit dark patterns  
- Limit data brokers  
- Ensure opt-in consent  
- Establish algorithmic fairness  
- Guarantee breach notifications  
- **Provide fair compensation** when data is monetized  

Your data has value — and **so do you.**
